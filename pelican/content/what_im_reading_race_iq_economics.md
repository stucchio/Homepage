Ron Unz over at American Conservative has written an excellent blog post called [Race, IQ and Wealth](http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/race-iq-and-wealth/). It's well worth reading, gets into data, and is a fairly dispassionate analysis of the topic. It also (politely and subtly) calls out the supposed "experts" on the field, who ignore all sorts of valuable data (quite a bit of which actually supports their views) merely because their ideological opponents present it.

I strongly recommend [reading it](http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/race-iq-and-wealth/).
