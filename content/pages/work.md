I am a Data Scientist (formerly known as "Statistician") and I am currently doing anti-fraud machine learning at [Affirm](https://affirm.com).

Things I'm good at:

- Data analysis/number crunching
- A/B testing and optimization
- Systems programming
- Functional programming

Here is my [formal resume](work/resume.pdf). I am best contacted at *hi@chrisstucchio.com*.

**For Recruiters:** I don't have time for unsolicited phone calls or fishing expeditions - send me an email. Include enough details in your email to allow me to quickly evaluate whether the position you are recruiting for is a good fit. I will not get on a call with you to discuss what I'm looking for. The [resume](work/resume.pdf) here is my most current and is only available in pdf format (LaTeX doesn't output to Word).

**For the curious:** The resume was made with latex, specifically the [moderncv](https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/moderncv/?lang=en) package. Source is [here](work/resume.tex).
