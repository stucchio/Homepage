The USA is much bigger than NY and SF - combined!

There's a popular narrative going around that a 1980's middle class standard of living is no longer achievable. As an example of the genre, consider `Life in The Simpsons Is No Longer Attainable <https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/12/life-simpsons-no-longer-attainable/617499/>`_.

> Homer, a high-school graduate whose union job at the nuclear-power plant required little technical skill, supported a family of five. A home, a car, food, regular doctorâ€™s appointments, and enough left over for plenty of beer at the local bar were all attainable on a single working-class salary....
> But their life no longer resembles reality for many American middle-class families.

This article is of course quite silly. The Simpsons always lived in Springfield, a podunk town with nothing nearby but a nuclear power plant and a monorail. The author complains that buying a home on $42k/year (Homer's inflation adjusted salary), but house prices in `Springfield IL <https://www.zillow.com/springfield-il/>`_ range from $10-100k (max of $600 monthly mortgage cost), `Springfield OR <https://www.zillow.com/springfield-or/sold/?searchQueryState=%7B%22pagination%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22mapBounds%22%3A%7B%22west%22%3A-123.17453638623047%2C%22east%22%3A-122.55312220166016%2C%22south%22%3A43.93059513068739%2C%22north%22%3A44.21745680724729%7D%2C%22regionSelection%22%3A%5B%7B%22regionId%22%3A7223%2C%22regionType%22%3A6%7D%5D%2C%22isMapVisible%22%3Atrue%2C%22category%22%3A%22cat2%22%2C%22filterState%22%3A%7B%22sort%22%3A%7B%22value%22%3A%22globalrelevanceex%22%7D%2C%22fsba%22%3A%7B%22value%22%3Afalse%7D%2C%22fsbo%22%3A%7B%22value%22%3Afalse%7D%2C%22nc%22%3A%7B%22value%22%3Afalse%7D%2C%22fore%22%3A%7B%22value%22%3Afalse%7D%2C%22cmsn%22%3A%7B%22value%22%3Afalse%7D%2C%22auc%22%3A%7B%22value%22%3Afalse%7D%2C%22ah%22%3A%7B%22value%22%3Atrue%7D%2C%22rs%22%3A%7B%22value%22%3Atrue%7D%7D%2C%22isListVisible%22%3Atrue%2C%22mapZoom%22%3A12%7D>`_ ranges from $50-450k, and `Springfield MO <https://www.zillow.com/springfield-mo/>`_ has houses ranging from $50-200k. The author of the piece lives in `Kalamazoo MI <https://www.zillow.com/Kalamazoo-MI/>`_ which has plenty of houses for sale at a similar price. A person earning $42k/year should have no trouble buying most of these houses.

Other `articles in the genre <https://nypost.com/2018/06/23/why-the-middle-class-cant-afford-life-in-america-anymore/>`_ push a similar narrative.

1. Observation that rent in NYC, Silicon Valley and Washington DC (popular places for journalists to live!) are skyrocketing.
2. Observation of increasing urbanization, and people moving to cities to get jobs.
3. Observation that national median wages (ignoring benefits!) are not keeping up with NYC/SF real estate, college costs and health care costs (which are mostly not paid from wages!). At this point, they will usually provide anecdotes about people in high status low pay professions (teaching, journalism, fashion design) struggling to live in an expensive place.
4. Insert anecdotes about homelessness here.

This narrative is absolutely true for journalists and techbros in Silicon Valley or NYC. All these folks suffer from a malthusian scarcity of housing created by the governments of NYC and Silicon Valley. People typically need to live with roommates and pay exhorbitant sums to rich landlords who got lucky enough to buy real estate much earlier. For the journalist, fashion designer or professor (techbros are rarely the anecdote provided in these articles), it's quite true that life in these places is difficult. A journalist in NYC or SF `earns about $50k/year <https://www.salary.com/research/salary/recruiting/journalist-salary>`_.

But this narrative is false for America. As it turns out, the USA is much larger than these regions! Not only that, these regions represent a shrinking proportion of the US.

In 1970, the `NYC <https://www.macrotrends.net/cities/23083/new-york-city/population>`_ and `SF metro < https://www.macrotrends.net/cities/23130/san-francisco/population>`_ areas had 18 million people and accounted for 8.4% of America. As of 2020, they had grown to only 22M people and accounted for 6.6% of America. That means 93.4% of `America <https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/USA/united-states/population>`_ lives elsewhere.

People are moving to cities for work and amenities. But the cities people move to are not the ones popular in narrative - the cities with the largest numeric increase in population over the past 10 years were Phoenix, Houston and San Antonio. The liust of `top 15 cities with largest numerical increases in population <https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2020/south-west-fastest-growing.html>`_ does include NYC at #7, right between Ft. Worth and Charlotte.

Hypothetically, suppose our struggling reporter decided she was done with NYC and wanted to live the good life. What could she do?

One option would be to join lots of other people and become a `medical coding specialist <https://www.salary.com/research/salary/alternate/medical-coding-specialist-salary>`_ and move to San Antonio. She can earn $54k - similar to her journalism salary - and afford to buy many houses in the `$150-250 ballpark <https://www.zillow.com/san-antonio-tx/>`_, nearly all of which will be nicer than her shared flat in Brooklyn.
